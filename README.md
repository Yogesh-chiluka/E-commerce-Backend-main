Project Structure

Major Components

Entity Classes: Represent database tables (e.g., Product, User, Order).

Repository Layer: Interfaces extending JpaRepository for database interactions.

Service Layer: Business logic for handling operations.

Controller Layer: REST API endpoints for interacting with the application.

DTOs (Data Transfer Objects): Used to transfer data between layers.



---

Security

The project integrates Spring Security with JWT-based authentication. Access to endpoints is controlled based on user roles.

Key Security Components

UserSecurityService: Custom user details service.

JWT Util: Manages JWT creation and validation.

SecurityConfig: Configures security filters and endpoint restrictions.


JWT-Based Authentication Flow

1. Users log in via /auth/login to receive a JWT.


2. The JWT is included in request headers to authenticate and authorize user actions.
