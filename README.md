   ```

3. **Configure the Database:**
   Open the `application.properties` file and set your database connection details:
   ```properties
   spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/your-database
   spring.datasource.username=your-username
   spring.datasource.password=your-password
   ```

 <a name="Security"></a>
## Security
The project uses **Spring Security** with JWT-based authentication:
- **UserSecurityService**: Custom user details service.
- **JWT Util**: Manages JWT creation and validation.
- **SecurityConfig**: Configures security filters and endpoint restrictions.

### JWT-Based Authentication Flow
1. Users log in via **/auth/login** to receive a JWT.
2. The JWT is included in request headers for authentication and authorization.
